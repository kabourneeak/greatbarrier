				<h3>Using the Whitelist</h3>
				<section>
					<p>This extension uses your whitelist to determine which sites
					should be trusted and browsed normally, and which sites should be 
					opened in a separate window, isolating them from your trusted
					sites.</p>
					
					<p>Your whitelist should consist of those sites which have a lot of your
					personal information and which you use on a regular basis. For example,
					your email account, which may be open all day, is a good candidate 
					for your whitelist. Your favourite news site, on the other hand, is
					not a good candidate for your whitelist, since there is very little 
					need for the news site itself, and especially its advertisers, to
					be able to track your browsing history, or to potentially link your
					browsing history to your email or social networking accounts.
					</p>
				
					<p>When creating a new whitelist entry, you should enter just 
					the domain of the site. Some examples of how to write 
					whitelist entries are as follows:</p>
					<dl id="wlexamples">
						<dt>example.com</dt>
						<dd>This entry will put all pages from example.com on your whitelist.</dd>
						<dt>mail.example.com</dt>
						<dd>This entry will put all pages from mail.example.com on your whitelist, but not those from, say www.example.com.</dd>
						<dt>http://example.com</dt>
						<dd>This entry is incorrect; don't type the http:// when adding a site to your whitelist.</dd>
					</dl>

				<h3>About this Project</h3>
				<section>
					<p>This extension is open-source and is freely available at
					<a href="https://github.com/kabourneeak/greatbarrier" target="_blank">
					https://github.com/kabourneeak/greatbarrier</a>. This extension
					does not record, store or transmit any personal information or browsing 
					history information. Your settings may be synchronized with Google's 
					servers, but are not accessible to the authors of this extension.
					</p>
				
					<p>This extension was created by Gregory Bint and Gehana Booth
					of Carleton University, Canada,
					as part of a usable security project. The project was motivated 
					by the authors' interest in &quot;Separated Browsing&quot;, 
					a mindset which aims to keep advertising and other tracking
					technologies from interacting with sensitive personal information.
					<p>
					
					<p>Often, separated browsing is accomplished by simply using 
					more than one browser; one for sensitive sites, and another 
					for general browsing.		
					However, even for a motivated individual, this separation
					can easily be foiled by something as simple as following a
					link from an email message when in a hurry or when otherwise
					distracted.
					This extension aims to provide for seamless, automatic 
					separation of web browsing, while reducing
					or eliminating the need for the user to be constantly 
					thoughtful of where each link is headed.
